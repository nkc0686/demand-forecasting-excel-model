# Demand Forecasting Excel Model

This repository contains a lightweight Excel-based demand forecasting model designed to compare multiple forecasting methods and explicitly track forecast error.

## Purpose
The model is intended to support operational decision-making by illustrating how different forecasting approaches perform under real-world demand variability.

## What the model includes
- Multiple demand forecasting methods
- Forecast error calculation and comparison
- Clear separation between input data, forecasts, and evaluation metrics
- A reference sheet explaining assumptions and formulas

## Intended use
This model is designed for educational and decision-support purposes. It is suitable for small to medium-scale planning scenarios where transparency and interpretability are prioritized.
The model prioritizes transparency and interpretability over algorithmic complexity.

## Limitations
- The model is not automated or optimized for large-scale production use
- Results depend on the quality and stability of historical demand data
- External factors such as promotions, policy changes, or supply disruptions are not explicitly modeled

## Related work
This project complements an inventory planning model that translates demand uncertainty into inventory policy decisions.
